        This reduces the size of the generated SQL when computed fields are
        included and as such helps to make it more readable

                Property type describes if the reference is 'strict' or
                'informative'.


                Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.


                An informative reference is just an int field that points

                to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints

                or foregein key cascades.
