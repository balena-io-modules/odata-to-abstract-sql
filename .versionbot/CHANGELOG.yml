                                                representation of the returned
                                                object from pinejs should be
                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                                        Return big integer values as strings
                                        instead of bigint as we need to

                                        parse them back into strings anyway when
                                        returning data from pine. The

                                        new logic and types closely follow the
                                        same pattern we have for dates.

                                The internal and external representation of the
                                returned object from pinejs should be
                                consistent.

                                Pinejs internal interface will return date or
                                date time fields as date object. For the
                                external interface the object is
                                JSON.stringified so that date becomes an ISO
                                string anyway.

                        whilst being

                        converted to bind variables

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                                        Ensure that the input passed in for JSON
                                        types is either an object or

                                        an array (typeof returns 'object' for
                                        arrays as well). This change is

                                        mainly to prevent primitives from being
                                        stored as JSON.

                        The internal and external representation of the returned
                        object from pinejs should be consistent.

                        Pinejs internal interface will return date or date time
                        fields as date object. For the external interface the
                        object is JSON.stringified so that date becomes an ISO
                        string anyway.

              hash: 7d4bfac3b0dbcc6f916c90837398aff1e84588bc
              body: >
                After every write, pine has to rerun all rules from the model to
                ensure

                consistency. These rules run over the entire database, sometimes
                causing

                some queries to run for too long against what should be a simple
                write.


                This commit adds a mechanism to help with this issue by
                narrowing the

                set of rows that each rule should touch to those rows that were
                actually

                changed.


                Implementing this mechanism safely is doable and not necessarily
                complex

                code-wise, but requires a deep modifications from the current

                architecture. This commit adds a restricted form instead where
                we only

                narrow the rows of the root table that were changed. If any
                other table

                was changed then narrowing is a no op.


                It can be proved that this is always safe as long as the root
                table is

                selected from only once and the rule is positive ("It is
                necessary that

                each ...").


                The implementation here adds a single binding into the rule's
                SQL query

                which can be bound by pine for each rule where an opportunity to
                use

                this optimization arises.


                The implementation itself is simple: count how many times the
                root table

                is selected from and if it is selected from exactly one, then
                add a

                narrowing constraint in the form of:


                $1 = '{}' OR

                <root table>.id = ANY(CAST($1 AS INTEGER[]))


                Where $1 will be bound to either '{}', which disables narrowing,
                or to a

                list of IDs that were affected by the write.


                This initial implementation can be extended in the future.

      hash: 253fdae228cf1edd5e9137819b1bbe783c0e72b0
      body: |
        This avoids issues where the aliases may not map up, particularly if
        the definition was generated and may have automatic aliases, eg if
        using the result of an odata-to-abstract-sql generation

                isNumericValue is evaluated in arithmetic expressions

                if operands in expression can be used as numericValues.


                In SQL statements arithmetic expressions like add/sub are
                supported for date values.

                DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent typing.

                Property type describes if the reference is 'strict' or
                'informative'.


                Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default
                'strict'.


                An informative reference is just an int field that points

                to another tables id field - like foreign key without
                constraints

                or foregein key cascades.

                        This allows specifying the correct type to cast to when

                        functions happen

                        to be integers
